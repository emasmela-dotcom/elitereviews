## 🤔 **COMMON CONFUSIONS:**

### **"Do I need to test the products myself?"**
❌ **NO!** You research existing reviews and write YOUR informed opinion based on that research. Just like Car and Driver, CNET, etc.

### **"Do I credit other reviewers?"**
❌ **NO!** You research multiple sources, form YOUR opinion, write in YOUR words. It's YOUR review as EliteReviews.

### **"Do I need to buy every product?"**
❌ **NO!** You research extensively, read reviews, watch videos, check specs. Then write an informed review.

### **"How much do I make per review?"**
💰 **Depends on the product!**  
- $399 headphones (3% commission) = $12  
- $29,999 side-by-side (5% commission) = $1,500  
- $3,000 vacation (6% commission) = $180

**Mix high and low ticket items!**

### **"When will I make money?"**
📅 **Timeline:**  
- Month 1-2: Setting up, first reviews  
- Month 3-4: First sales ($50-300)  
- Month 6: Regular income ($500-1,000)  
- Month 12: Solid income ($2,000-5,000)

**Patience and consistency = success!**
