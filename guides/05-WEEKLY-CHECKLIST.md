## 💡 TIME-SAVING TIPS

### **Get Faster Each Week:**

**Week 1:** 3 hours (learning)
**Week 4:** 2 hours (getting the rhythm)
**Week 8:** 90 minutes (total pro)

### **Shortcuts:**

1. **Use the same product card template** (copy-paste-edit)
2. **Save AI prompts as Chrome bookmarks**
3. **Keep a "Product Ideas" note** (add ideas as you see them)
4. **Batch your social posts** (write both on Friday, schedule for Monday)
5. **Set a timer** (gamify it - beat your time!)

---

## 🆘 IF THINGS GO WRONG

### **"I'm stuck on writing the review"**
→ Use the AI prompt exactly as written
→ Just get something done (perfect is the enemy of done)
→ You can improve it next week

### **"The website won't update"**
→ Make sure you saved the file
→ Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
→ Wait 2 minutes, try again
→ Worst case: redeploy manually via Vercel

### **"I don't have 2-3 hours today"**
→ Do just 1 review (better than 0!)
→ Or split it: research Monday, write Tuesday
→ But try to stay on schedule!

### **"I'm not feeling motivated"**
→ Remember your goal: passive income, financial freedom
→ Just do 1 hour, take a break, finish later
→ Look at your progress (you've added X reviews!)
→ Think about when this site earns $3K/month (it will!)
