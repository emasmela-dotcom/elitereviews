<!-- ADD NEW PRODUCTS HERE -->
```

Paste your new product card right after this line.

### "The image isn't showing!"

1. Check the image URL works (paste in browser)
2. Make sure it starts with `https://`
3. Try a different image source

### "How do I know what rating to give?"

Based on your research:
- 5 stars: Exceptional, best in class
- 4.5 stars: Excellent with minor flaws
- 4 stars: Very good, solid choice
- 3.5 stars: Good but has issues
- 3 stars: Average, has pros and cons

### "The site won't deploy!"

1. Make sure you saved the file (`Cmd + S`)
2. Check for syntax errors (missing `>` or `</`)
3. Try again in 5 minutes

### "I'm stuck!"

**Don't stress!**
- Skip that review, do it next week
- Use a simpler product
- Copy an existing review structure exactly
