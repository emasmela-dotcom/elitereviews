## 💡 PRO RESEARCH TIPS

### **Don't Copy Reviews!**
❌ Don't copy exact words from other sites
✅ Read several reviews, take notes, write in your own words
✅ AI helps but you still edit and personalize

### **Look for Patterns:**
If 5 reviews say "battery life is disappointing" → That's real feedback!

### **Check the Date:**
Tech changes fast. Use reviews from the last 6-12 months.

### **Read the Bad Reviews:**
The 1-star Amazon reviews often reveal real issues!

### **Compare Prices:**
Check multiple sites (Amazon, BestBuy, manufacturer) for current pricing.

### **Watch Video Reviews:**
5-minute video > reading 3 text reviews. You see the actual product!
